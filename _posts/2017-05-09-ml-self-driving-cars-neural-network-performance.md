title: Foo Café talk on Neural Network performance
---

On 9 May 2017 I was invited to [Foo Café Malmö](https://foocafe.org/) to give a second talk on Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars. This talk builds upon the [20 April 2017 Behavioral Cloning talk]({% post_url 2017-04-20-ml-self-driving-cars-behavioral-cloning %}) and focuses on improving neural network performance. The recording is now available to watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqyas8K4McA).

**Description**

*How do we achieve high performance Neural Networks for Self-Driving Cars? We will consider frequently encountered obstacles and proven solutions. This event builds on the Behavorial Cloning presentation from 20 April 2017 and will be more technical. We will explain data manipulation, neural network tricks, and computer vision to unlock better performance without collecting more data. This presentation will be friendly but may contain mathematics and code. You have been warned!*
