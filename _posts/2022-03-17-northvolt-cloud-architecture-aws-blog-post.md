title: Northvolt Cloud Architecture blog post published with AWS
---

Two Northvolt colleagues and I have collaborated on a blog post that describes the high-level design of the Northvolt cloud environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS). We introduce the concept of Cloud Factory Modules and explain how they are used to design and build a scalable platform for multiple large connected factories. The full blog post is published as part of *AWS for Industries* and can be found here: [Northvolt’s next-gen connected factory—a digital blueprint factory built from scratch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/northvolts-next-gen-connected-factory-a-digital-blueprint-factory-built-from-scratch/).
