title: Perspective on Machine Learning for Li-ion batteries published in Joule
---

I am delighted to have been part of a team writing a forward-looking Perspective on the future of data-driven Li-ion battery research with focus on improved safety. The Perspective was a collaboration with co-authors from NREL, MIT, Tsinghua, and Imperial College and is now available in the academic journal Joule. The full text can be accessed at the Joule journal website: [The Application of Data-Driven Methods and Physics-Based Learning for Improving Battery Safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435120305626), with direct link to [download PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435120305626/pdfft?isDTMRedir=true&download=true).

One of the most intriguing sections, **Practical Implementation for Commercial Applications**, takes inspiration from the field of robotics and automation research where a neural network is used to combine data from simulation and real-world experiments to achieve high accuracy with comparatively small datasets. Further resources for a deeper dive into this approach[^1] is available through the KTH twitter account.
