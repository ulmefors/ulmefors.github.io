title: Imperial College talk on Northvolt Giga-scale Li-ion manufacturing
---

On 10 December 2019 I was invited to Imperial College London to give a talk on Northvolt's progress so far, and what's in store for the future. The title was **Giga-Scale European Li-ion Manufacture**: *Bold bets, deep analytics, sustainable by design*. The session was jointly hosted by [Energy Futures Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/) and [Dyson School of Design Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/). The recording is now available on YouTube.
